# Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
# Planning:
first I sketch the application, then I transfer the sketches to Figma to create application prototype
 to show all application features. Then after finishing the prototype App design I transfer to Android
 Studio to start design fragments & layouts. After finishing the design, I start the coding using Kotlin
 language to create "TODOLIST App "
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Way Of Development:
 When I start working on" TODOLIST App" it was challenging from where I should start, so I start design the App features
 then after that I start creating DataBase, After that I start coding to make the Application Run, After running the App
 it will work efficiently to save & edit tasks.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem solving  strategy:
 my problem strategies to solve the errors by google searching, material design website, Mr. Mohamed,
 Mr.Saad, medium website.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
unsolved problems:
 - one of the interesting problems it was in editing the due date the code was working fine but when we
   edit the date to upcoming month it will appear 0 in the due date textview , so I had to search to find another
   code that it wont be show this error.
 - Other problem was in design the screen of the fragment from where should I start and which screen I should go
 - Also I had major problem in variable Id's some time I put wrong Id to the variable, so I learned how to check
   if the Id is wrong or correct by pressing "ctrl" to check if all the Id's are from the same layout.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Describe how some of your favorite functions work
 - One of favorite function was date picker it was easy and make the code easy.
 - Also other interesting  that I had learned this project is "Material Card View" it give the design more
   flexibility to work with and change it's shape, color, stroke.....etc
