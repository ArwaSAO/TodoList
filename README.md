# Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
 - first I sketch the application
 - then I transfer the sketches to Figma to create application prototype to show all application features.
 - Then after finishing the prototype App design I transfer to Android Studio to start design fragments & layouts.
 - After finishing the design, I start the coding using Kotlin language to create "TODOLIST App ".
 - Way Of Development: When I start working on" TODOLIST App" it was challenging from where I should start,
  so I start design the App features, then after that I start creating DataBase, After that I start coding
   to make the Application Run, After running the App, it will work efficiently to save & edit tasks.
# Problem solving  strategy:
 my problem strategies to solve the errors by google searching, material design website, Mr. Mohamed,
 Mr.Saad, medium website.
#List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
unsolved problems:
 - filtering
 - sorting
 - notification if the task is completed or uncompleted
 - using another database not just the local database that we used
# Describe how some of your favorite functions work
 - One of favorite function was date picker it was easy and make the code easy.
 - Also other interesting  that I had learned this project is "Material Card View" it give the design more
   flexibility to work with and change it's shape, color, stroke.....etc
